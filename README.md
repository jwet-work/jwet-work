| 6 | Zomato customer analysis segmentation | Analyze the business performance of restaurants and customers registered in the service. Who are Zomato’s customers? What segments can we split them into? What is their purchasing behavior? Parsing through 5 tables of data which were joined in Tableau into one mass data table build a report of clear insights and recommendations on the customers and what the business can do to retain or grow the user base moving forward. |
